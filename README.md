# Take5
My final BrainStation project was inspired by my previous career as a sport scientist 🏋🏻‍♂️ 👨🏻‍🔬 <br><br> Take5 allows users to track wellness data by simply filling out a quick survey of 5 categories each morning. The app will then provide score-based feedback along with tips and advice on how to improve those categories that were scored poorly.

# The Code
Take5 is a full-stack SPA that utilised the following tech 👇
- HTML
- CSS/SASS
- Animate.css
- JavaScript
- React
- Node
- Express
- Axios
- Chart.js

# How Do I Use It?
1. CLONE the repo from my GitHub to your local machine!
2. SETUP by navigating to BOTH the server and client folders and running:
```
$ npm install
```
3. START the server and check the app is listening on PORT:5000
4. RUN the client and start using the app! 😃
